# Toy project to help kids with Math

gen.py can generate a list of probelems for addition and substraction
for a range specified. Found it useful for kids to solve thise kinds
of problems.

Output will be written to standard output so needs to me redirected
to a file.

There are some options to use with the script:
* _*-s*_ key will make output data ordered
* _*--range*_ will specify the maximum number (does not quite work
for odd numbers for addition), default value is 20
* _*--operation*_ can be either addition or substraction, default is
addition
* _*--columns*_ number of columns in csv file, default value is 4
